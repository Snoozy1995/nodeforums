Node forums is a forum solution made by Snoozy1995.

Nodeforums requires you to have access to node.js, (node.js modules) as well as a database.
This ultimately creates the forum solution. The solution is managed through its own process and thus also serves as a webserver.

Hence if you wish to be running this as a forum part of a bigger website, you would probably like it to listen to /forums/ for starters.
